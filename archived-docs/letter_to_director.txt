<h2>TITLE:</h2> Schism Report

<p>Dear Director McFlurry.

As per your request, I have conducted a thorough investigation and analysis of the "Schism" you have tasked me with.

Using Scranton Reality Beacons, it has been concluded that the Hume levels are lower than baseline, confirming that the anomaly is reality-altering in nature.

However, research has shown that the area isn't the source of the anomaly, rather, it is a byproduct of an, as of yet undocumented, CK-Class Restructuring Event, if not numerous.

To spare you the details, the area appears to be a "wound" in reality, an artifact of a previous one that has leaked into our current one. The consistent inconsistency also imply that it is a wound that has not healed several times.

In conclusion, I suggest establishing a Research Site at ████████████, as no other threats have been detected, at least so far.

Sincerely,
    Dr. Barrett
