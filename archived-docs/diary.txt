    Busy day today. Extra work at the warehouse, something something stock clearance. Had to take Ma to the clinic as well, her arthritis is worse in this weather. It’s as if this day just WANTS to test my limits.
Bossman was extra agitated, and that means he was extra snarky. Like, it’s not MY fault the pallets were not perfectly aligned, I’m not a walking talking computer that can accurately measure the precise alignment of each box. Why would that even matter? Asshole.
Then I also had to clean up Taras’ mess: he ripped open one of the boxes full of dolls, so we had to stitch that box up and perfectly pack those dolls up again. Who even buys those. They look like some Victorian child abused those things for years… Maybe some art project commission?
At least Ma was kind today. Usually her joint pain makes her all grumpy; today she was actually sweet. Probably pulling a facade, but still, she’s a champ. Doc at the clinic said it was some temporary swelling, so it’ll pass in time.

    I woke up to the sound of sirens this morning. At first, I thought it was just another emergency, but then I saw the news. The city is going into lockdown. Apparently, there's a new virus going around, and they want to contain it. I'm glad I took Ma to the clinic yesterday. It's going to be chaotic out there.
I went to work, but it was a ghost town. The warehouse was closed, and Bossman told us to go home. He said he'd call us when things got better. I don't know what I'm going to do without a paycheck, but I guess I'll figure it out.
The streets were empty, and there were cops everywhere. They're enforcing martial law now. It's scary. I've never seen anything like this before. I heard on the news that they're not letting anyone in or out of the city. We're trapped.
Ma is worried about the food supplies. She said we need to stock up before the stores run out. I went to the grocery store, but it was chaos. People were fighting over toilet paper and canned goods. It was like the end of the world. I never thought I'd see something like this.
I don't know what's going to happen next. All I know is that things are getting worse by the minute. I hope we can get through this.

	It's been a few days since the lockdown started, and things are getting even more bizarre. There are people appearing in town claiming to be from other countries, yet they seem to be familiar with our local town. It's like they've been here before. They speak in strange accents and wear clothes that I've never seen before. They claim to have been trapped in the city with us.
At first, I thought they were just trying to take advantage of the chaos, but there's something about them that seems genuine. They're scared, just like us. I talked to one of them today. He said his name was Ahmed, and he was from Syria. He said he was here on business before the lockdown started. He showed me his passport, and it looked legit. He said he had no idea how long he'd be stuck here.
It's weird having all these strangers in town. I don't know how to feel about it. On the one hand, I feel sorry for them. They're stuck here just like us, with no way out. On the other hand, I'm scared. What if they're carriers of the virus? What if they make things worse?
The government is doing their best to take care of them, but I don't know how long they can keep it up. The food supplies are running low, and there's no telling when this lockdown will end. I just hope we can all make it through this, and that things will go back to normal soon.

    I couldn't take it anymore. Being cooped up in the house all day was driving me crazy. I needed to get out and see what was happening in the rest of the town. So, I decided to sneak out and explore.
I knew it was risky, but I had to take the chance. The streets were deserted, and the cops were patrolling every corner. I had to stay low and avoid any attention.
As I walked around, I noticed something strange. The signs were in French. I didn't understand it at first, but then it hit me. I wasn't in my hometown anymore.
It was surreal. The streets were empty, and everything was quiet. It was like I was in a completely different world.
I kept walking, trying to find my way back to my side of town. I didn't want to get caught by the cops or end up in some French prison. I had to be careful.
On my way back I found a group of people protesting. They were waving signs and shouting in French. I didn't know what they were protesting about, but I could tell they were angry.
I didn't want to get caught up in their demonstration, so I turned around and headed back. I had seen enough. I needed to get back home.
When I got home, Ma was worried sick. I didn't tell her where I had been or what I had seen. I didn't want to worry her anymore than she already was.

	This makes no sense. I’m going mad. How can we be in Germany AND France AND the US AND the UK at the same time?

	The world has gone to shit. A UN spokesperson gave a speech, saying something about global Martial Law, the UN taking over, some other nonsense. I’m too tired…
I heard the cops started investigating our sewers. Which would be hilarious if it weren’t for the fact that more often than not they never return. The fuck is happening?
