<h3> Note found next to Artifact ██████ in Redwood Catacombs. Artifact was sold to MC&D rep. </h3>
I was on a seaside town, the sand of the beach was white and the sea a deep blue, when I met a beautiful girl,
we immediately connected and found ourselves having a fantastic time together in the few days we were there.
We spent whole days together, basking in the hot summer sun, swimming in the crystalline sea,
whole nights together watching the night sky and the dark waves of the expansive sea.

Time passed.
One day I woke up and those moments felt distant like a dream, at points I wasn't even sure they weren't.
You see, sadly we were not able to stay in touch.
We hadn't even been able to say goodbye to each other.

While rummaging through an old backpack, I stumbled upon a folded note bearing the same phone number scribbled hastily three times, with minor variations in certain digits.
Intrigued, I attempted to dial some of these numbers into my phone.
The first two attempts yielded no results, leading me to conclude that they were likely outdated and non-functional, a remnant of the past.
Nonetheless, I decided to give the third number a chance, and to my astonishment, it turned out to be hers!

We talked again, and it was as if no time had passed.
We talked for hours at a time.
We were each other's whole worlds.
We planned so many things, so many adventures, we wanted to see each other again, oh with so much fervour.

One day I woke up and those moments again felt distant like a dream, I wasn't even sure they weren't.
I looked around.
All those memories,
were just a dream.
