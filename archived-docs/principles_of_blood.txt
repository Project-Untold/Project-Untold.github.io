<h2>TITLE:</h2> The Principles of Hemomancy
<h2>AUTHOR:</h2> Unknown, presumed member of █████████. Original text obtained during █████████ sect neutralization.
<h2>CONTENT:</h2>

The true goal of any zealot of █████, despite the moth-eaten teachings of the orthodox cults, is apotheosis through might and will.
This irrefutable fact means that those holding more power would hide their secrets from those who would usurp them.

This is <b><i>abhorrent</i></b>.

I have sought out these secrets, shedding skin, blood and flesh, both mine and others, to gather this power.

I do not wish to deny you this knowledge. For if all possess it, then the worthy will emerge not from cowardice and deceit,
but from might and will.

The Art of Hemomancy is not simply the ability to control the flow of blood or mutate the cells of flesh.
The Art of Hemomancy is a division of Principles that each demand mastery.

Many dedicate themselves to a single Principle, without even realizing it, and many are not able to master more that one Principle.

However, knowing about them, studing them opens many doors you might not have known existed, and will lead to great might,
for those with the will to master it.

<span id="red">The Principle of the HEART</span>: <span id="red">The Heart</span> teaches the mastery of the body and the passion. Most <span id="b">Nälkä</span> follow this Principle, for it is the closest
to the preachings of ███. <span id="red">The Heart</span> allows the master to both staunch the flow of their blood, and to inflict it unto their foes.
<span id="red">The Heart</span> may exite those afflicted, and seduce them to sacred rituals they would not partake in otherwise.

<span id="gray">The Principle of the MOTH</span>: <span id="gray">The Moth</span> is a Principle of change, of chaos, of restlessness, of becoming. Those who master the Moth master their own being, manipulating their self to fit their erratic situations.

<span id="yellow">The Principle of the LIGHT</span>: <span id="yellow">The Light</span> is an unpopular Principle, for it is associated with the plague that is ███████.
However, the wise would know that the █████ worshipped the spawn of Vil-Nijan, and it is <span id="yellow">The Light</span> that opposes them.
<span id="yellow">The Light</span> is a Principle of knowledge, of visions, of clairvoyance. Many secrets were learnt by master of <span id="yellow">The Light</span>, being able to see that which is hidden from them.

<span id="swampgreen">The Principle of the DAGGER</span>: It is no secret that the <span id="b">Nälkä</span> have many enemies, and <span id="swampgreen">The Dagger</span> provides the means to deal with such nuisances.
The simple contrarian would argue that the use of steel is heretical, but is the ritualistic dagger not a tool of the hallowed rites?
<span id="swampgreen">The Dagger</span> allows the master to wield their tools with immaculate precision, and to create tools from their own sacred body.

<span id="lightblue">The Principle of the SILENT</span>: <span id="black"> Fear what must be dead, yet refuses to die </span>
