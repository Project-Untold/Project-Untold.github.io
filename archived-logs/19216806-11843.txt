<blockquote><span class="speedDown"></span><span id="a">X</span>: This is X, over.
<span id="a">Y</span>: Y here, receiving you X.
<span id="a">X</span>: Just wanted to share that I had a great time at the Cockerel Fair this weekend. The cockerels were magnificent.
<span id="a">Y</span>: Glad to hear that. Did you get a chance to see the display by the Cockerel Appreciation Society?
<span id="a">X</span>: Yes, I did. They had some of the most beautiful cockerels I've ever seen.
<span id="a">Y</span>: I know, right? I've been following their work for a while now. Did you know that they recently convinced the local government to create a protected area for wild cockerels to breed?
<span id="a">X</span>: That's amazing! Their dedication to these cockerels is truly inspiring.
<span id="a">Y</span>: Definitely. I'm thinking of joining the society myself. It would be great to connect with other people who share our appreciation for cockerels.
<span id="a">X</span>: I completely agree. Let me know if you decide to join. We can go to the next meeting together.
<span id="a">Y</span>: Will do. Thanks, X.
<span id="a">X</span>: No problem, Y. Keep me posted. Over and out.<span class="speedNormal"></span></blockquote>
