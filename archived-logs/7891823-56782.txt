<h2>BEGIN LOG:</h2>
<blockquote><span class="speedDown"></span><span id="a">X</span>:Beneath the world's gaze, in the subterranean labyrinth, a chilling revelation awaited.
In the depths, I stumbled upon a tableau both grotesque and captivating.
<span id="black">THEY LEFT SECRETS</span>
A morbid ballet of shadows and blood-soaked remnants danced before my eyes, illuminated by the distant glimmer of a solitary lantern.
<span id="black">THEY MAY BE GONE, BUT THEIR FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE REMAINS</span>
An eerie beauty shone through the grimness, igniting an unsettling fascination.
My breath quickened as I gazed upon the amalgamation of horror and allure.
<span id="black">I HAVE SEEN FOREVER</span>
And as the truth etched itself into my mind, I couldn't escape the chilling reality that had led me here — a silent sacrifice, veiled in darkness, to possess such unearthly beauty.
The echoes of a life extinguished reverberate through these tunnels, their secrets buried beneath the weight of the earth.<span id="black">BLOOD WOOD BLOOD WOOD BLOOD WOOD</span>
This confession, a whisper in the underground abyss, tells a tale known only to the walls that hold their secrets close.<span class="speedNormal"></span></blockquote>
