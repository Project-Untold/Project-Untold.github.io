<h2>INFORMATION:</h2> Worship and ritualism of the Flesh and Blood have always been considered taboo, both by the anomalous world and the mundane, yet that has not stopped those curious, zealous or desperate enough to embrace the Sarkic teachings of the Grand Karcist Ion.

The Order of Bloodwood is estimated to have formed shortly after Incident Zero, after the pathological horrors in the Redwood facility having breached and leaked into the world... Though it is not certain whether the cult itself is responsible for the infestation of the underground, or whether the infestation has attracted or corrupted denizens into forming their cult there...

A Sarkic Cult, the Order believed in the power of the flesh and disease, and worked tirelessly to increase their power and influence over the city, and their own bodies.

Sarkic rituals and practices are, naturally, deemed illegal and dangerous to the safety of humanity, with the UNGOC openly targeting any suspect of such activity. Yet the Order still thrived, and ultimately, hoped to consume the surface and anyone caught in their way...

Recent expeditions and sweeps have found abandoned shelters and posts that used to be occupied by the Order's cultists, while the cultists themselves have seemingly vanished. It is not known what happened to them, but by all accounts they are gone. Yet their influence remains. And its a matter of time until someone tries to carry on their teachings and practices...
