<h2>INFORMATION:</h2> Drifters are the normal denizens of Redwood City. Due to the nature of the city, there is no defined nationality, with every person being a representative of their own nation and culture. Likewise, their desires and intentions are unique to themselves.

Drifters have the right to open small businesses, as well as carry certain weapons for self defense. Additionally, the GOC may recruit them as a "freelance expeditionary force" to be sent to various locations, if the GOC themselves doesn't have or isn't willing to expend any of their own personnel.

Ultimately, as denizens of Redwood City, drifters are forbidden from entering and exploring the underground systems, as per quarantine laws, with the punishment for the crime of ignoring the law being death.

Though, those who truly want to go there always find a way...
