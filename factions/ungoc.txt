<h2>INFORMATION:</h2> The United Nations Global Occult Coalition, UNGOC, was a secretive section of the United Nations, tasked with protection of humanity from the threat that is the Anomalous. Being comprised of various minor organizations of paratechnological and thaumaturgical nature, they are well equipped to combat any threat that cannot be subdued with conventional means.

After the Broken Masquerade, the GOC has established executive control over most governments and political entities, in order to maintain human civilization from total collapse. Redwood City was no exception, as it had an SCP Foundation facility hidden within it, a source of inhuman horrors and secrets that the GOC would wish to be kept Untold.

The GOC may send task forces into the Redwood underground to perform sweeps and exterminate any threat that resides there, be it anomalous or otherwise. Additionally, they may commission freelancers to be sent of expeditions and sorties to investigate or eliminate any potential threat to humanity...
