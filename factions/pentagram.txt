<h2>INFORMATION:</h2> It is no secret that the United States of America had the largest military budget in the world, larger than the next 20 countries' military budgets combined. It is, however, not known by many just how much was spent on anomalous warfare...
The Occult Branch of the Department of Defense, codenamed: "Pentagram", was founded in parallel with the Unusual Incidents Unit of the FBI, in the heat of the Cold War, though its secrecy was held to the highest priority, even among the anomalous world. While the mundane branches have worked tirelessly to develop new rifles, armor, aircraft and naval vessels, Pentagram worked tirelessly to develop new anomalous and paratechnological weaponry. Ultimately, their mission wasn't to protect the world or to destroy it. It was simply to lead the US to victory, whatever the cost.

After Incident Zero, the Unites States of America were met with an uneasy order: cede their liberty and political independence to the Council of the United Nations, specifically the Global Occult Coalition, to protect its citizens from the devastating breach of anomalous threats. Initially, the US government complied, more so after numerous of its members, including the President, were identified as anomalous, and thus, a threat...

Pentagram did not take what they saw as defeat and a failure, lightly. No less than a year after Incident Zero, numerous sleeper agents of Pentagram staged a coup d'Ã©tat against the UN ruling body of the US. Some states remained loyal to the UN, seeing that unity is the only means of overcoming the obscure threat, while others embraced the new Pentagram rule, hailing patriotic zeal and pride over the oppressors that stole their freedom...

The United States of America is experiencing a second Revolutionary War, and Pentagram will not give in until every ounce of American soil is free again...
