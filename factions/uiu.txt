<h2>INFORMATION:</h2> The Unusual Incidents Unit used to be the most revered and prestigious unit of the FBI during the Cold War. Used to.
Then it became the butt of jokes of the anomalous world, the kid who still could not tie their own shoelaces. The UIU was regarded as an incompetent parody of other anomalous groups. They couldn't contain anomalous as well as the Foundation could, they couldn't destroy them as well as the UNGOC could, and they didn't have nearly as large a budget as Pentagram, its military counterpart.
And yet, the UIU still tried, having their moments of fame and glory once in a blue moon, such as boasting its pride title of peacekeepers of the anomalous "Three Portlands" and "Backdoor SoHo".

After Incident Zero, the UIU found themselves between a rock and a hard place. Suddenly they were needed everywhere, everywhen. Their already minuscule forces spread thin to assist the GOC, Pentagram, and any other community trying to survive the chaos that the dead Foundation left them. They were almost wiped out, having suffered heavy casualties too severe for such a small force.

After Pentagram's coup, the UIU split into to factions: one loyal to the UNGOC, and the other loyal to Pentagram. Both maintain the role of peacekeepers and policing force on American soil, being the closest anomalous group available to an American citizen in need. Both trying almost futilely to perform the task of containing left by the Foundation.
Only on different ends of the civil war...
